The Slider component has a slight slide animation whenever each dot is clicked. There is also a Button component and some text on top of the Slider.

The InfoBoard component makes use of the envelope and page SVG file. The envelope button links to an email.

The DemoBoard component has some precentages with a slight pulsing animation. The Button component has also been reused here.

The Checkerboard component also has a slide and fade animation when the page loads with a one second delay. I would of liked it to animate on scroll but I didn't have enough time.
