## Intro

This webpage is a random client page with an orthodontic theme. I created a 'data.json' file to store most of the text and images that were used on this assignment. I then used axios to pull the data out of the json file. The text is from Bacon Ipsum and images are from Unsplashed. The webpage is completely responsive and makes use of flexbox. Animations were done with css transitions, transforms, and keyframes. I also used Sass and Semantic UI for some css elements.


## Preview

The Slider component has a slight slide animation whenever each dot is clicked. There is also a Button component and some text on top of the Slider.

The InfoBoard component makes use of the envelope and page SVG file. The envelope button is sticky and links to an email.

The DemoBoard component has some precentages with a slight pulsing animation. The Button component has also been reused here.

The Checkerboard component also has a slide and fade animation when the page loads with a one second delay. I would've liked it to animate on scroll but I didn't have enough time.
