# front-end-dev-test

[front-end-dev-test-mt.herokuapp.com](https://front-end-dev-test-mt.herokuapp.com)

I created a 'data.json' file to store most of the text and images that were used on this assignment. I then used axios to pull the data out of the json file.


## Preview

The Slider component has a slight slide animation whenever each dot is clicked. There is also a Button component and some text on top of the Slider.

The InfoBoard component makes use of the envelope and page SVG file. The envelope button links to an email.

The DemoBoard component has some precentages with a slight pulsing animation. The Button component has also been reused here.

The Checkerboard component also has a slide and fade animation when the page loads with a one second delay. I would of liked it to animate on scroll but I didn't have enough time.

## Please also submit a small write up discussing

1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

I used React because it is one of my favorite technologies to work with. I'm still trying to improve my skills with React and I thought this would be a good opportunity. It might have been a gamble because using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would certainly have been much easier, but I had enjoyed using React.

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?

I had some trouble working with SVG files because I've never used them before. I also wanted to use React Router but ended up not using it because I would of had to restructure some of my components and lack of time.

3. What you enjoyed the most and why?

I really enjoyed everything about this assignment. I love front-end development and had a blast especially working with React.
